# Introduction
This repository has a few intentions surrounding it. The first and foremost is to act as my first attempt at deploying using GitHub pages as I feel this is a very cool feature I was just made aware with GitHub.

The second is of course, to create a ReactJS app with all concepts and features I am aware of while doing something fun by consuming a free public API surrounding one of my favorite TV shows currently, Rick and Morty.

I want to thank [GitHub Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#games--comics) for showing me the location of the [actual API I will be using](https://rickandmortyapi.com/).

## History
I used [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) to get this started after getting this repository set up.
